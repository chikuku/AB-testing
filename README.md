# A/B Testing Project: Evaluating the Impact of Product Videos on E-commerce Sales
Background & Overview
This project analyzes an experiment conducted by a mid-size women's apparel retailer in the US. The retailer aimed to determine whether adding product videos to their website could boost e-commerce sales. The study also explored how combining this feature with other promotional strategies influenced customer behavior and overall sales performance.

## Project Outline
This analysis is divided into three key parts:

1. **Assessing Group Balance with a T-Test**  
  **Goal**: Ensure the treatment and control groups have similar product prices to avoid selection bias.  
  **Conclusion**: Product prices were balanced between the groups, confirming the validity of the experiment.
2. **Measuring the Effect of Product Videos on Sales**  
  **Goal**: Investigate whether adding product videos directly increases sales.  
  **Conclusion**: Adding videos led to a statistically significant increase in sales.
3. **Analyzing the Interaction of Videos and Promotions on Sales**  
  **Goal**: Understand the combined effect of product videos and other promotional strategies on sales performance.  
  **Conclusion**: The interaction of videos and promotions further increased sales, suggesting a synergistic effect.
